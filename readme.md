# Elements

This will be the study for materials and textures as a collection for my research on my phone. 

- Mood/Material Diary for myself to keep track of.
- If I can make it public then you would create your own login and store that on the database?
- Be able to share with friends or other platforms to store them
- A quick tool to store your thoughts and view them
    - [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- one page per day
- camera input
- able to erase certain parts - mask the shape
    - [trace on top to keep the element](https://candle.itch.io/flatpack)
    - background removing API - paid
    - image cropping algorithm?
- swipe to set the date and time and create - inspo linked

# Steps of creation recommended by Max

1. make things in ps - constrains of how you make the thing 
2. build the make and save part of the interface 
3. ability to view all and save 

# Scrapbook

Using direct image manipulation (panning, scaling & rotating), design a touch-based collage interface.

## **What is your app for?**

Collecting interesting materials related to moods for my thesis. My thesis is about translating feeling of being trapped and suffocation through objects or experiences. 

## **How do users add images/text?**

Users can upload their images or capture with their camera in the app and edit the texts

## **How do they remove them?**

I will create a trash icon where they can move the item and delete it

## **What are the constraints?**

They are limited to the canvas of their phone since they can not scroll in the canvas. 

# Progress

**Next Steps** 

1. Allow user to draw on top 
2. Save to the canvas 
3. localStorage solution to check other saved creations in collections 
4. sharable with friends 
5. better UI 
6. potential for music in the bg 

# Research

I did research on ProjectLife and PicCollage. Some of the pros and cons I learned from playing with them are as below:

1. You can search image on the web and input it to the canvas
2. They have grid system where you can put images to the chosen grid 
3. Adaptable size for different social media platforms to share
4. Customizable in terms of color, patterns
5. Tutorial UI example from picCollage
